# push_swap
 42 project asking you to create a sorting algorithm in C

You have two stacks, a and b. All of the integers to sort start in stack a.

The actions available to you are:
Push_A (PA): Move the top integer from b into a;
Swap_A (SA): Swap the top two integers in a;
Rotate_A (RA): Move the top integer in a to the bottom of a;
ReverseRotate_A (RRA): Move the bottom integer from a to the top of a;


Push_B (PB): Move the top integer from a into b;
Swap_B (SB): Swap the top two integers in b;
Rotate_B (RB): Move the top integer in b to the bottom of b;
ReverseRotate_B (RRB): Move the bottom integer from b to the top of b;
